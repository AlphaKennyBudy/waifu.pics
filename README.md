# Simple server for redirecting to the images on [waifu.pics](https://waifu.pics/)

![](https://waifu.now.sh/sfw)

### I wrote this server in order to be able to get random anime images for markdown

## API

Here are different endpoints for API requests.

```
"sfw",
"nsfw",
"neko",
"lewdneko",
"trap",
"bully",
"cry",
"hug",
"kiss",
"lick",
"pat",
"smug",
"highfive",
"nom",
"bite",
"slap",
"wink",
"poke",
"dance",
"cringe",
"blush",
"shinobu",
"random"
```

## How to get an image

Just go to the https://waifu.now.sh/ followed by endpoint. E.g. https://waifu.now.sh/random will give you a random image.

## How to use an image in Markdown

Just put the above url in typical Markdown syntax

```markdown
![](https://waifu.now.sh/kiss)
```

## WARNING. Don't forget that "random" endpoint includes all other endpoints (NSFW too). So, in order to not get involved in confusing situations you can use "sfw" instead.
